# AI Coder Guidelines

1. Write **comprehensive unit tests** for every function and module.
2. Follow **TypeScript best practices** and ESLint rules for code quality.
3. Use **descriptive variable and function names** for clarity.
4. Provide **JSDoc comments** for every function, explaining parameters and returns.
5. Ensure **all code is modular** and reusable.
6. Include **error handling** for edge cases and unexpected inputs.
7. Prioritize **efficient algorithms** for processing large PST files.
8. Document every API endpoint with Swagger/OpenAPI.
9. Support **complex queries** for search functionality (e.g., projects, participants).
10. Write **automated tests** for React components using Testing Library.
11. Use **lazy loading** for large datasets where applicable.
12. Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
13. Ensure **file storage is secure and scalable** using MinIO.
14. Optimize conversational querying with a structured schema for LLM input.
15. For file operations use cmd /c.
16. Make sure tests run in parallel for both backend and frontend tests.
17. When testing we shouldn't use real services - they should be mocked.
18. We use Windows Terminal, so ensure compatibility with Windows.
19. Use **TypeORM decorators** for entity definitions and database operations.
20. Implement **proper file validation** using NestJS built-in validators.
21. Use **dependency injection** for better code organization and testing.
22. Follow **NestJS module structure** for organizing related functionality.
